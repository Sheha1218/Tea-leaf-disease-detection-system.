 Tea Leaf Disease Detection Using AI

Excited to showcase my latest AI project! I developed a Tea Leaf Disease Detection System that uses deep learning to classify tea leaf diseases with high accuracy.

 Technologies Used:
 	Machine Learning & Deep Learning: TensorFlow,CNN
	Web Development: Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	Image Processing: OpenCV, NumPy
 	Deployment: Flask-based API

Detects:
	Detects: Algal Leaf, Bird Eye Spot, Brown Blight, Gray Light, Red Leaf Spot, White Spot, and Healthy Leaves.


Web-based interface for easy image uploads and real-time predictions

This project highlights the power of AI in agriculture, helping farmers detect diseases early and improve crop health
